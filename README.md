# Download a QBCore Server [Dev Branch] [WIP]

### Disclaimer
- If this is your first time installing a QBCore server, this isnt for you. I suggest using TXAdmin and installing it from the popular templates.

- This was created so devs could easily get all the updated repos without having to go through TXAdmin and install a whole new server

- This is also a way for me to learn github sub modules so its safe to say this whole repo is a huge WIP

### Requirements

- An already existing server
- Github desktop (or something of the sorts)
- Some knowlage of Github

### Instalation

- Delete Everything is your current servers `resources` folder
- Clone the repo through Github desktop
- Drag the folders you just cloned into your `resources` folder
- Start your server
